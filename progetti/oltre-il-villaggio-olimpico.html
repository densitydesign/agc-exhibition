These posts were categorized into 8 categories representing various stakeholders, and keywords were extracted through an automated process, followed by manual verification. The analysis also delved into the use of images revealing that, within their posts, all stakeholders express various opinions about the project, using significant lexical variations while employing the same renders of the Olympic Village. Four images were selected among the most frequently used ones, based on their adaptability to graphical manipulation through AI. Employing a machine learning model, these images were processed, expanding margins and filling the resultant space with content linked to the 10 most commonly used keywords for each stakeholder. These frames highlight how each category interprets the theme differently, influenced by its own perception, by transforming opinions into visual images. The exhibition layout has been designed to provide an engaging and informative experience for the visitors. The table, measuring 130x70cm, features four binders, each dedicated to one of the renders selected from the "Beyond the Games" research. Each binder contains eight frames, one for each stakeholder category, distinguishable by the labels affixed to each. When pulled from the stand, visitors can superimpose the frames on the original image fixed on the table, facilitating direct interaction between the image and the perspectives of the various stakeholders. On the bottom of each frame, the 10 keywords used by the artificial intelligence model to process the images are listed, offering visitors an additional interpretive key. The image manipulation software employed is Stable Diffusion (SD), an advanced machine learning model introduced in 2022. SD stands out for its capability to generate images from text. To initiate the graphic manipulation process, specific prompts were crafted based on keywords derived from the research. After identifying the 10 most frequent keywords from each category of stakeholders, a categorization into adjectives and nouns occurred. Nouns were associated with concrete objects to be incorporated into the generated scene, while adjectives were linked to graphic variations, such as color changes within the image. The words were further organized into five categories representing their contextual meaning: "analytical spirit," "green spirit," "sponsors," "infrastructure," and "motivational spirit." Subsequently, each keyword underwent a process of transformation into a sentence explaining its meaning in the specific context. Recognizing SD's better performance with single words, the same sentences were simplified into single words or pairs of words separated by commas to optimize interaction with the software. To make the best use of Stable Diffusion's features, we mainly used two extensions: Control Net and Civit.AI Helper, from which the Realistic Vision model was downloaded and used to manipulate the images. The text2img tab was used to expand the original renders. As prompts the reworked keywords were used as previously described and with different weights depending on their frequency in the posts, plus the keywords "RAW photo, realistic, subject, 8k uhd, dslr, high quality, Fujifilm XT3" to improve the final quality of the render. The negative prompt and two negative embeddings, Bad Dream and Unrealistic Dream, were also employed. The process followed to expand the images is as follows: using Control Net's inpaint model in the resize and fill mode, the image was first scaled horizontally from 1024px to 1920px and then also vertically until it reached the height of 1080px and the new parts were created according to the prompt provided. Finally, the resulting images were refined by correcting some details using the inpaint function of the img2img tab also within Stable Diffusion.</p></section></article> <div class="column images svelte-11tn9s7" aria-label="Project Images"></div> </div>
